# Polymorphism

### Animal
- Create a class called `Animal.java`
- Give the Animal class the following data fields/members
  - Name
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Create getter and setter methods
- Create a method called sound which prints "sound"

### Dog
- Create a class called `Dog.java` that is a subclass of Animal
- Give the Dog class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "woof"

### Cat
- Create a class called `Cat.java` that is a subclass of Animal
- Give the Cat class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "meow"

### Pig
- Create a class called `Pig.java` that is a subclass of Animal
- Give the Pig class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "oink"

### Snake
- Create a class called `Snake.java` that is a subclass of Animal
- Give the Snake class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "hiss"

### AnimalTester
- Create a program called `AnimalTester.java`
- Create an empty ArrayList of Animal objects
- Add a Dog object to the ArrayList
- Add a Cat object to the ArrayList
- Add a Pig object to the ArrayList
- Add a Snake object to the ArrayList
- Iterate through the list and call each object's sound method
