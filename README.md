### Cat
- Create a class called `Cat.java`
- Give the Cat class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Create a method called sound which prints "meow"

### Pig
- Create a class called `Pig.java`
- Give the Pig class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Create a method called sound which prints "oink"

### Snake
- Create a class called `Snalke.java`
- Give the Snake class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Create a method called sound which prints "hiss"

### AnimalTester
- Create a program called `AnimalTester.java`
- Create an empty ArrayList of Animal objects
- Add a Dog object to the ArrayList
- Add a Cat object to the ArrayList
- Add a Pig object to the ArrayList
- Add a Snake object to the ArrayList
- Iterate through the list and call each object's sound method
