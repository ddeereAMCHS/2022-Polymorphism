- Give the Dog class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "woof"

### Cat
- Create a class called `Cat.java`
- Give the Cat class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors
- Override the sound method to print "meow"

### Pig
- Create a class called `Pig.java`
- Give the Pig class no additional data fields/members

- Override the sound method to print "oink"

### Snake
- Create a class called `Snake.java`
- Give the Snake class no additional data fields/members
- Create a default and parameterized constructors

### AnimalTester
- Create a program called `AnimalTester.java`
- Create an empty ArrayList of Animal objects
- Add a Dog object to the ArrayList
